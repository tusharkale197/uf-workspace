Math for Intelligent Systems Homework 4
Problem statement:
2. Multi-class Linear Classifier
•   Download the Iris dataset available at the UCI Machine Learning repository in the platform of your choice.
•   Execute a homegrown multi-class least-squares classifier on the Iris dataset after separating it into training and test set patterns.
•   Documentthetrainingandtestingmis-classificationerrorsandseparateouteachclasserrors using a confusion matrix (3 × 3 with diagonal values being true positives).
•   Document the settings of the free parameters (if any). Give a high level summary of your findings based on your interpretation of the results.
•   The ratios attempted for training and testing should be 12% training/88% testing, 30% train- ing/70% testing and 50% training/50% testing
    (and these percentages should be class spe- cific as much as possible). There is no need to perform cross-validation.
•   Include the source code and printouts in your submitted homework. Add a link to the pdf if you wish.
