# uf-workspace

This respository has all the code related to projects, homework assignments and practice coding done during my 
MS in Computer Science at UF.

PS: The repo goes private when a homework assignment is in progress.

Legend-
-   AOA - Analysis of Algorithms

-   MIS - Maths for Intelligent Systems
    *   HW2 - Homework 2 - Principal Component Analysis
    
PS:Each folder has its own utils file.

PPS:I make an effort to follow coding conventions and best practices (Anything and everything from doc strings and inline comments and indentation(TABS |m|) to project file structure) wherever I can and whatever that I have picked up from my industry experience as a software engineer.

PPPS: (YES this is a PS on the above PPS so it is a recursive PS (O.o) WITHOUT a base case :D ) Open to criticism! Drop me a line if you think I've picked up the wrong things and I'll promptly try and improve on that.
