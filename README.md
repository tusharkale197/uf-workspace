# uf-workspace

This respository has all the code related to projects, homework assignments and practice coding done during my 
MS in Computer Science at UF.

PS: The repo goes private when a homework assignment is in progress.

Legend-
-   AOA - Analysis of Algorithms
-   MIS - Maths for Intelligent Systems
    *   HW2 - Homework 2 - Principal Component Analysis
	 
Each folder has its own utils file.

	I make an effort to follow coding conventions and best practices (Anything and everything from doc strings and inline comments and indentation(TABS |m|) to project file structure) wherever I can and whatever that I have picked up from my industry experience as a software engineer.
	Open to criticism! Drop me a line if you think I've picked up the wrong things and I'll promptly try and improve on that.
