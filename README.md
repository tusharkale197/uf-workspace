# uf-workspace

This respository has all the code related to projects, homework assignments and coding practice I do during my 
MS in Computer Science at UF.

PS: The repo goes private when a homework assignment is in progress.

Legend-
-   AOA - Analysis of Algorithms
-   MIS - Maths for Intelligent Systems
    *   HW2 - Homework 2 - Principal Component Analysis
    *	HW3 - Homework 3 - Singular value Decomposition
    *   HW4 - Homework 4 - Multi-class Linear Classifier

	 
Each folder has its own utils file.

	I try to follow coding conventions and best practices 
	(anything and everything from doc strings and inline comments to project file structure or 
	whatever I have picked up from my industry experience as a software engineer) wherever I can.
	Open to criticism! Drop me a line if you think I've picked up the wrong things and 
	I'll promptly try and improve on that.
